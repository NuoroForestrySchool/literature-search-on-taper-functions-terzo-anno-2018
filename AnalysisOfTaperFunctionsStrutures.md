# Introduction

## 2018 Forest Inventory course - Collective students' work
Students, as homework, were asked to search for scientific papers presenting 'taper functions' and to compile a collective Rmarkdown document shared using GIT.  
Rearranging their work, this document lists their findings.  

# Results of students' searches
